This contains solutions that are written (almost) entirely by Github Copilot.

The only parts written by me are:

- The runner (run.ts)
- The function shell (templates/copilot.ts)
- Comments inside the function

Everything else is Copilot. Starting this in 2022, so a lot of the years before
might have actual solutions in the training data.
